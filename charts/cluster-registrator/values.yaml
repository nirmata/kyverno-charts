# Whether registrator should install kube-controller with readonly or read-write permissions.
# For NDP we provide a read-write-ndp role that has a lot more perms than read-write
# Roles needed by the kube-controller are ultimately decided based on support in server logic.
# This parameter can be used as an additional gate for privilege escalation prevention so that
# we don't provide read-write perms even if yamls downloaded from service need that.
# Currently simple read-only and read-write flag, but we could have more shorthands for
# variations such as: * on polexes but read-only on policy-reports, etc.
